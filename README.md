AI-Powered Phishing Detection Tool
A comprehensive web application that analyzes emails for phishing threats using pattern recognition and risk assessment algorithms.
🔗 Live Demo: 🔗 **Live Demo:** [phishmenot.netlify.app](https://phishmenot.netlify.app)


🚀 Features

Real-time Email Analysis: Paste suspicious emails and get instant phishing risk assessment
AI-Powered Detection: Analyzes over 25 phishing keywords and suspicious patterns
Visual Risk Scoring: Color-coded risk levels (Low/Medium/High) with percentage scores
Header Analysis: Examines email headers for spoofing and authentication failures
Link Safety Check: Identifies suspicious URLs, HTTP links, and domain spoofing
Brand Impersonation Detection: Flags emails pretending to be from legitimate companies
Analysis History: Tracks previous scans (stored locally)
PDF Report Export: Generate professional security reports
Educational Content: Built-in guide for common phishing red flags

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Icons: Lucide Icons
PDF Generation: jsPDF
Deployment: Netlify
Security: Client-side processing (no data transmission)

📊 Detection Capabilities
The application analyzes emails across multiple dimensions:

Language Patterns: 25+ common phishing keywords
Domain Analysis: Typosquatting and misspelled domains
URL Safety: HTTP vs HTTPS, suspicious link structures
Authentication: Email header validation
Urgency Tactics: Time-pressure language detection
Brand Spoofing: Major brand impersonation attempts

🔍 How It Works

Email Input: Users paste suspicious email content (headers + body)
Pattern Matching: Scans for known phishing indicators
Risk Calculation: Assigns weighted scores to different threat types
Visual Reporting: Displays results with explanations and recommendations
Educational Feedback: Explains why specific elements are suspicious

📈 Risk Scoring Algorithm
javascript// Simplified scoring logic
let riskScore = 0;
riskScore += foundKeywords.length * 10;        // Phishing language
riskScore += suspiciousDomains * 30;           // Domain spoofing
riskScore += urgencyIndicators * 15;           // Pressure tactics
riskScore += brandImpersonation * 25;          // Corporate spoofing
riskScore += suspiciousLinks.length * 10;      // Malicious URLs

// Cap at 100% and categorize
const riskLevel = riskScore > 70 ? 'HIGH' : 
                  riskScore > 30 ? 'MEDIUM' : 'LOW';
